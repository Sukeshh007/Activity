This is the NumberGeussing Game :-

The game initializes a random number and sets up variables to track guesses and attempts.
It repeatedly prompts the user for input, providing feedback on whether guesses are too high or too low.
The game handles special cases like revealing the number or handling invalid inputs.
The game ends when the user guesses correctly or uses all their attempts, and then prompts to play again.
